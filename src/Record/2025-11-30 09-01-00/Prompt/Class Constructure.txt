Before writing the script {SCRIPT_FILE}.cs, we will first list the information about the classes that should be written in this file. We need to list the required member variables and member functions. There may also be cases where other classes that have not yet been written are needed. In such cases, we must not only verify if the class exists within Unity but also check reference_data to confirm if it exists elsewhere.
