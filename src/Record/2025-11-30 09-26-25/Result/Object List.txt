  "rule": "Two paddles compete to hit a ball back and forth across the playing field. When a player fails to return the ball with their paddle, the opponent scores one point. The ball increases in speed with each successful hit, progressively increasing difficulty. The game continues until a predetermined score is reached or the session ends. In single-player mode, the player competes against an AI-controlled opponent.",
