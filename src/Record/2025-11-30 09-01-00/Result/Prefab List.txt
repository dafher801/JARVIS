      "name": "Paddle",
      "targets": ["PlayerPaddle", "AIPaddle"],
      "role": "A rectangular paddle entity that moves vertically along its designated side of the playing field to intercept and return the ball. Contains visual representation (sprite/mesh), collider component for ball collision detection, and base movement functionality.",
      "reason": "Both PlayerPaddle and AIPaddle share identical visual appearance, collision behavior, and movement mechanics (vertical movement constrained to field bounds). The only difference is the control source (player input vs AI logic), which can be handled by attaching different controller scripts to the same base prefab. This promotes code reuse and ensures visual consistency between player and opponent paddles."

      "name": "Wall",
      "targets": ["TopWall", "BottomWall"],
      "role": "A collision boundary object positioned at the horizontal edges of the playing field that reflects the ball when contacted. Contains a collider component configured to bounce the ball at appropriate angles.",
      "reason": "TopWall and BottomWall are functionally identical objects with the same collision behavior and visual representation, differing only in their position (top vs bottom of the field). Creating a single Wall prefab allows for consistent collision handling and easy placement at both boundaries without duplicating assets or code."

      "name": "GoalZone",
      "targets": ["LeftGoalZone", "RightGoalZone"],
      "role": "An invisible trigger zone positioned behind each paddle that detects when the ball passes through, triggering a scoring event. Contains a trigger collider and references to identify which side scored.",
      "reason": "Both goal zones serve the same purpose of detecting when the ball exits the playing field on their respective sides. They share identical detection logic and only differ in position and which player receives the point. A single prefab with a configurable 'scoring side' parameter enables consistent scoring detection while avoiding code duplication."

      "name": "Ball",
      "targets": ["Ball"],
      "role": "The central gameplay object that spawns at the center of the field, travels between paddles, bounces off walls and paddles, and accelerates with each successful hit. Contains visual representation, physics/collision components, and movement properties.",
      "reason": "While there is only one ball in the game, making it a prefab is essential for the spawning system. The BallSpawner needs to instantiate the ball at game start and after each point is scored. A prefab allows for clean instantiation, destruction, and re-spawning of the ball with consistent initial properties each time."

      "reason": "CenterLine is a unique, static visual element that exists only once in the scene and never needs to be instantiated dynamically. It has no gameplay logic, no collision behavior, and no need for reuse. It should be placed directly in the scene as a simple sprite or line renderer."
