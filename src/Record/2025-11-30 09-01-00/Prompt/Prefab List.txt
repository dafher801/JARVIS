I'm developing a game in Unity. Among the listed objects, identify those that can be generalized and abstracted as prefabs. For each prefab, specify which objects it generalizes/abstracts as a single class and what role it serves. Do not include objects that don't need prefabs or are inappropriate to make into prefabs.
{
  "prefabs": [
    {
      "name": <<<Write the name of the prefab.>>>,
      "targets": [ ... ] <<<Among the listed objects, write which objects are generalized or abstracted as multiple strings.>>>,
      "role": <<<Write the role of the prefab in detail.>>>,
      "reason": <<<Write the rationale for generalizing or abstracting it as a prefab.>>>
    },
    .....
  ],
  "none_prefabs": [
    {
      "name": <<<Write the name of the prefab.>>>,
      "role": <<<Write the role of the prefab in detail.>>>,
      "reason": <<<Write the rationale for generalizing or abstracting it as a none prefab.>>>
    },
    .....
  ]
}
