      "targets": ["PlayerPaddle", "AIPaddle"],
      "role": "A rectangular paddle entity that can move vertically along the playing field to intercept and return the ball. Contains visual representation (sprite/mesh), collider component for ball interaction, and base movement functionality.",
      "reason": "Both PlayerPaddle and AIPaddle share identical visual appearance, collision behavior, and core movement mechanics. They differ only in their control source (player input vs AI logic). By creating a single Paddle prefab, we establish consistent physics, collision responses, and visual properties while allowing different controller scripts to be attached or configured per instance."

    {
      "name": "Wall",
      "targets": ["TopWall", "BottomWall"],
      "role": "A boundary wall that defines the vertical limits of the playing field. Contains a collider component that causes the ball to bounce upon contact, maintaining the ball within playable space.",
      "reason": "TopWall and BottomWall are functionally identical—both serve as collision barriers that reflect the ball. They share the same collision properties, visual style (or invisibility), and physics behavior. Creating a single Wall prefab allows for consistent boundary setup and easy repositioning at top and bottom positions."

      "role": "A trigger zone positioned behind each paddle that detects when the ball passes through, signaling a scoring event. Contains a trigger collider and references which side should receive the point when activated.",
      "reason": "Both goal zones function identically as scoring triggers—they detect ball entry and notify the ScoreManager. The only difference is which player benefits from the trigger activation, which can be configured via a simple parameter. A single prefab ensures consistent trigger behavior and scoring detection."

      "name": "ScoreDisplay",

      "role": "A UI element that displays the current score for one side of the game. Contains text component for score rendering, formatting logic, and update methods to reflect score changes from the ScoreManager.",
      "reason": "Both score displays share identical functionality—rendering a numeric score value with the same visual style and update behavior. They differ only in position and which score they represent. A single prefab enables consistent typography, scaling, and animation while allowing flexible positioning and data binding."

      "reason": "There is only one Ball instance in the game at any time. While it could technically be a prefab for spawning purposes, it represents a unique singleton object with specific spawn logic handled by BallManager. It doesn't generalize multiple similar objects."
