This project is not intended to generate revenue; it is a test project conducted for experimental purposes. We will recreate the game "Pong" exactly as it is. We simply need to recreate the well-known game as it is. A ball spawns in the center and travels toward one side. Players control paddles that can move up and down on either side to hit the ball back toward the opponent. The ball speeds up with each hit, and the side that fails to hit the ball back scores a point for the opponent. Initially, only single-player mode will be provided.
