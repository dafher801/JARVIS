This script provides a public method for moving the paddle up or down based on input (either from player input or AI commands). It enforces movement constraints to prevent the paddle from moving outside the designated play area by clamping the paddle's vertical position to the top and bottom boundary limits."

It also triggers the ball speed increase mechanism and plays the paddle hit sound effect through communication with the AudioManager."
