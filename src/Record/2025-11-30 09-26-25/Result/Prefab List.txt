      "role": "A rectangular paddle object that can move vertically along its designated side of the playing field to intercept and deflect the ball. Contains collision detection for ball interaction and visual representation of the paddle.",
      "reason": "Both PlayerPaddle and AIPaddle share identical visual appearance, collision properties, movement constraints (vertical only), and ball interaction physics. The only difference is the control source (player input vs AI logic), which can be handled by separate controller scripts attached to the same prefab base. This abstraction promotes code reuse and ensures consistent paddle behavior across both sides."

      "targets": ["TopBoundary", "BottomBoundary"],
      "role": "An invisible collision wall positioned at the edges of the playing field that causes the ball to reflect and bounce in the opposite vertical direction upon contact.",
      "reason": "TopBoundary and BottomBoundary are functionally identical objects that serve the same purpose of reflecting the ball. They share the same collision properties, dimensions, and physics behavior. The only difference is their placement position (top vs bottom of the field). Using a single prefab allows for consistent bounce behavior and easy modification of boundary properties."

      "role": "A trigger zone positioned behind each paddle that detects when the ball passes through, triggering a score event for the opposing side. Contains trigger collision detection and references to the scoring system.",
      "reason": "Both goal zones have identical functionality as trigger detectors for ball passage. They share the same trigger collision setup and detection logic. The only difference is which side receives the point when triggered, which can be configured through a simple parameter or tag. This abstraction ensures consistent goal detection behavior on both sides of the field."

      "reason": "While there is only one ball in the current design, making it a prefab allows for easy instantiation and destruction during gameplay (respawning after goals), potential future expansion to multiple balls, and clean separation of the ball object from scene-specific configurations. Prefabs are ideal for any object that needs to be spawned dynamically at runtime."
