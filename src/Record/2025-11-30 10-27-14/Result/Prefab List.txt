      "role": "A vertical rectangular paddle object that can move up and down along its designated side of the play area. It serves as the primary gameplay tool for hitting and returning the ball, featuring collision detection for ball interaction and constrained vertical movement within the play area boundaries.",
      "reason": "Both PlayerPaddle and AIPaddle share identical visual appearance, collision behavior, movement constraints, and physical properties. The only difference is their control source (player input vs AI logic), which can be handled through different controller components attached to the same base prefab. This reduces redundancy and ensures consistent paddle behavior across both entities."

      "role": "A horizontal collision barrier positioned at the edges of the play area that reflects the ball when contacted. It provides the physical boundaries that keep the ball within the playable space and creates the bouncing behavior essential to Pong gameplay.",
      "reason": "TopBoundary and BottomBoundary are functionally identical objects with the same collision behavior, visual representation, and purpose. They only differ in their position (top vs bottom of play area). Creating a single Boundary prefab that can be instantiated and positioned at either location eliminates code duplication and ensures consistent ball reflection physics."

      "reason": "Both goal zones have identical functionality as trigger detectors for scoring events. They share the same collision detection logic, trigger behavior, and communication pattern with the scoring system. The only difference is which side scores when triggered, which can be configured through a simple property or tag. A single prefab promotes maintainability and consistent behavior."

      "reason": "Both score displays share identical visual styling, update logic, and rendering behavior. They differ only in which score value they display and their screen position. Using a single prefab with configurable properties for which score to track ensures visual consistency and simplifies score display management and styling updates."
