You're a game developer, and you have an obligation to design a game and pitch it to clients so that it will be well-received by players, boosting your studio's reputation and generating significant revenue. You're at the stage of designing the game concept and narrative, and you need to create something very compelling to convince your fellow game designer colleagues. The content of the game design document is the most important and must be reflected. That's because it's the client's requirement, and if you don't honor their request, you won't secure the publishing deal.
