Includes movement speed configuration and boundary limit parameters to prevent the paddle from moving outside the playable area."

Calculates the reflection angle based on where the ball hits the paddle surface (center hits return straight, edge hits return at sharper angles). This creates more dynamic and skillful gameplay as players can aim their returns based on paddle positioning."
